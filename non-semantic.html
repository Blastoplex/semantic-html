            Graflex was a manufacturer that gave its brand name to several models of camera.

            The original lightsaber hilt carried by Mark Hamill in A New Hope was made from the flash attachment of a 
            Graflex 3 cell flash unit, with the ridged grips made by gluing portions of hard plastic T-track
            used for cabinet sliding doors onto the cylinder
